Becoming a better person requires that you have a general idea of the kind of person want to become. There is more than one definition of self, such as the belief that your mind exists separately from your body. Even people who are not religious believe in the duality of the body and soul. This belief has a huge impact on the way we perceive, and therefore act, on ourselves. In order to discover our own future, we must first ask the question: Who are we?

Who am I? I’m a Korean-born Canadian guy with a bachelor’s degree in business working as an iPhone developer in Vancouver. I follow Christ. My main hobbies are crafting, weight lifting, cooking and reading. I am single and casually looking. That description is a flattened version of myself in words.

But I was not who I described myself to be at birth. I was born with nothing. I didn’t know anything and couldn’t do anything other than breathe. The only way that we came to be who we are is through the actions we decide and the moments we perceive. And just as the way we came to be, the only way thwe are are giong to be who we will be in the future is also through the actions we decide and the moments we perceive. We are the results of our actions and perceptions. By understanding how we came to be, we can influence what we will become.
